# Vehicle Routing Problem Tester and Visualizer
This project allows users to test the Vehicle Routing Problem service from the REST endpoint, by providing a familiar UI. This JavaScript application allows users to pass in their parameters that they would normally pass, but with more control. This application will also display the route on a separate Map.

## Getting Started
The src folder is ready for deployment. This application is using an ArcGIS Online generated proxy, that has been configured to only work with the "esri.com" domain. (See ArcGIS Online Hosted Proxy documentation page for more details. Thus, any external users would need to modify the vrpServiceUrl variable in the app.js file to point to the Vehicle Routing Problem SErvice.
