# Vehicle Routing Problem Tester and Visualizer
This project allows users to test the Vehicle Routing Problem service from the REST endpoint, by providing a familiar UI. This JavaScript application allows users to pass in their parameters that they would normally pass, but with more control. This application will also display the route on a separate Map.
